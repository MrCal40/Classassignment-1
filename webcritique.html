        <h4>6 things I like about www.footlocker.com</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Their website has most things you will like all on the main page.</li>
    <li>I like the shoe image brings you to a section of the exact shoe with a breakdown in prices.</li>
    <li>I like the simple coloring nothing over dramatic with all kind of colors that take away from the shoes.</li>
    <li>The website is well put together their logo does not over power the products they are advertising.</li>
    <li>Besides the shoe images being clickable so are the logos which I think is a pretty neat feature.</li>
    <li>I like the fact the chat bubble follow up as you scroll up and down the website.</li>
</ul>
<h4>4 things www.footlocker.com can improve.</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The navigation towards the top when you click on a topic is not as fluent as I would like, it makes page it difficult to get back to the main page.</li>
    <li>I would like to have all the images loaded into different tabs.</li>
    <li>There is too much information at the bottom of the page, perhaps condensing some of the information into one.</li>
    <li>When you click on one of the top topics (new arrivals, men’s, women’s, kids’) there are too many selections.</li>
</ul>
